## Resources-used

## Future-plans

In the future, all the shape animation will be improved. The timing of the squares and the triangles will be tweaked. Presently, the circle animation is comically different from the intial plan.

The links in the Work section, aesthetically and content-wise are both elements that will be revisited. 

An animation feature will be added to the Contact Me section although more precise details are not yet decided.
