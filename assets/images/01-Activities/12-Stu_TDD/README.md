# 📖 Write Tests for Algorithms

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to create tests to define the expectations for algorithms that haven't been implemented yet. 

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the `reverse()` test expects the string `"Hello World!"` to become `"!dlroW olleH"` after calling `new Algo().reverse()`.

* It's done when the `isPalindrome()` test expects the string `"racecar"` to return `true` and the string `"neon"` to return `false` after calling `new Algo().isPalindrome()`.

* It's done when the `capitalize()` test expects the string `"capitalize every first word of the string."` to become `"Capitalize Every First Word Of The String."` after calling `new Algo().capitalize()`.

* It's done when the tests fail, because no code should be added to the `algo.js` file to fulfill the tests yet.

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the documentation:

## 💡 Hints

How can we use the `describe()`, `it()`, and `expect()` functions in Jest to check for expected behavior?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* Where can you find examples of well-written tests? 

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
