# 🏗️ Create Objects Using a Constructor Function

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to create new objects using a constructor function.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the constructor function is named `Developer()` and it takes in two parameters, `name` and `tech`.

* It's done when the parameters are passed into the object's keys as their values.

* It's done when the object's third key is a method called `introduction()` that prints a message in the console, introducing a developer's `name` and what `tech` they like.

* It's done when I create a new object using the `Developer()` constructor with a `name` and `tech` of my choice.

* It's done when the introduction of my new object is printed in the console.

## 💡 Hints

How can we use template literals to print an introduction like "Hi, my name is Rita and I love JavaScript"?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What are some built-in JavaScript constructors for native objects?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
